#+DESCRIPTION: Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

* Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is genrated by adding the previous two terms. By starting $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:

$$ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,...  $$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of even-valued terms.
