* Problem 25

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$$ F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, \textrm{ where } F_1 = 1 \textrm{ and } F_2 = 1.  $$

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$$ F_1 = 1 $$
$$ F_2 = 1 $$
$$ F_3 = 2 $$
$$ F_4 = 3 $$
$$ F_5 = 5 $$
$$ F_6 = 8 $$
$$ F_7 = 13 $$
$$ F_8 = 21 $$
$$ F_9 = 34 $$
$$ F_10 = 55 $$
$$ F_11 = 89 $$
$$ F_12 = 144 $$


The $12th$ term, $F_12$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits.
